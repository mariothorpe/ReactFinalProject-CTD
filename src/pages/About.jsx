                This is a roller coaster react app created for Code The Dream React course. This app allows coaster enthusiasts to search a database that i've created with airtable, of roller coasters by a variety of categories. Users will then be able to create an account and add roller coasters to their own personalized list. Whether you're a seasoned coaster enthusiast or brand new to the world of roller coasters, this app is a great way to track coaster credits. I hope you all enjoy and ride on!
